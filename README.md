This repository contains two hands-on Linear Regression projects, each focusing on different datasets and problem statements.
These projects helped me understand how regression works, how to prepare data, and how to evaluate predictive models.

🛠 Tools Used
Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Scikit-learn

🚀 Goal
To practice Linear Regression on different datasets and understand how model performance changes.
